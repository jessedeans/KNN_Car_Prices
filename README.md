# Predicting Car Prices Using K-Nearest Neighbors

The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a simple, easy-to-implement supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used to solve both classification and regression problems. In this project I will solve a regression problem, car price. I will also investigate the effect of varying parameters on the accuracy of a k-nearest neighbors prediction. First I'll independently vary the quality of features and number of nearest neighbors. Then I'll vary the number and quality of features and hyperparameters (number of nearest neighbors) in combination.
